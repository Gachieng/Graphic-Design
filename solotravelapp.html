      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>
        There is a gap in the market for a travel booking app that offers
        <br />solo traveller friendly packages without the common drawbacks.

      <h3 class="text-center">Background Research</h3>
      <p>
        Solo travel has been steadily on the rise in the past two decades with
        more people choosing to travel alone. Some contributing factors to the
        popularization of solo travel are:
      </p>

      <li>
        The rise of social media travel influencers popularizing the image of
        solo travel to make it seem enjoyable and more attainable to
      </li>
      <li>
        People feeling motivated to see the world without waiting for othersâ€™
        availability.
      </li>
      <li>
        The increase in remote work options post COVID has given people more
        flexibility to be able to work and travel at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        The rise of the digital nomad culture has driven governments to make
        visa provisions to accommodate these kinds of slow travelers who usually
        travel solo.
      </li>

      <br />
      <p>
        Solo travel has also had a negative stigma for the longest time with it
        being viewed as a practice for loners. But views are changing and now
        people have a more positive perception of it. Travel for One can
        successfully fill the market gap for solo travellers looking for a
        targeted travel booking app by creating an app that:
      </p>

      <li>
        provides easy comparison between itineraries with built-in flexibility
        options
      </li>
      <li>gives optional opportunities to socialise or spend time alone.</li>
      <li>has no single supplement penalties for solo travellers.</li>

          <div class="col-lg-6 mb-3 mt-3">
            <h3>Flashpack</h3>
            <p>
              Flash pack is a solo travel company for travelers in their 30s and
              40s. Focusing on an age group as a niche is helpful for aspiring
              travellers because it helps them to know what type of people to
              expect on their trip. It also helps them to connect with people in
              a similar life stage. Travel for One can offer age based trips to
              appeal to multiple age groups and appeal to a wider section of the
              market.
            </p>
            <p>
              Flash pack prides itself on offering unique travel experiences but
              needs to perfect other details such as; satisfactory accommodation
              and more inclusive meal package in order to justify the higher
              cost of the travel experiences they offer. Travel for one can
              capitalise on this weakness by including more meals in the travel
              packages to give travellers a more inclusive experience.
            </p>

            <p>
              The user interface on the view all trips page is a bit cluttered
              because it shows all available trips and the search filter section
              next to each other. A cleaner interface that reduces the trips
              shown and lets the search filter function show available trips for
              the users preferences could be more ideal.
            </p>

            <p>
              Travel for One can focus on creating a cleaner UI that is less
              cluttered, and incorporating a community building feature to
              appeal to solo travellers needs.

            <h3>Intrepid</h3>
            <p>
              Intrepid offers small group travel to its customers, 50% of whom
              travel solo. The small group travel appeals to solo travelers as
              they are able to easily connect with each other.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a dedicated section on their website that recommends the
              best trips for solo travelers makes it easy for those traveling
              solo to connect with each other. However, this section is not easy
              to find. Travel for One being a solo traveler app can make it easy
              for solo travellers to readily find information relevant to them.
            </p>

            <p>
              According to my research, providing options to choose the desired
              activity level and accommodation type which Intrepid offers, is
              also a huge plus for solo travellers. Travel for One can also
              benefit from having a similar feature.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, since Intrepid doesnâ€™t solely cater to solo travellers,
              they may not be the go to travel company for solo travellers. This
              leaves room for competitors like Flashback or Travel for One to
              appeal to solo travellers more.
            </p>
            <p>
              The optional single supplement offered by intrepid gives an option
              to have your own room but is a deterrent for solo travellers as it
              represents an added cost that can be avoided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Travel for One can avoid the single supplement cost altogether as
              a competitive advantage in the solo traveller market.

              <p>
                After conducting background research, doing a competitive
                analysis, and going through reviews from actual solo travellers,
                I was able to better understand the potential users for the
                Travel for One booking app and what their expectations would be.
                <br>
                These insights informed the creation of user personas to help
                guide the wire framing for the Travel for One app.

                  <p>
                    From researching competitor websites and solo travelers'
                    needs and pain points, I knew that I wanted the Travel for
                    One app to contain a number of features to make the user
                    experience pleasant and to ensure that the website meets
                    user expectations.
                    <li>
                      A filtering feature that allowed for trips to be tailored
                      based on destination type, age group or activity type to
                      allow for personalised use of the interface and easy
                      sorting through available trips.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A comparison tool for easily comparing between different
                      trips.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      An option for users to connect with other travellers
                      before or after trips to aid in community building and
                      reduce the anxiety solo travellers face before travel.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      A simple clean interface that makes it easy for users to
                      find information and navigate through the website.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    Incorporating these features and other insights gained
                    through researching competitor websites guided my wireframe
                    creation process.

                      <p>
                        After creating wireframes to get visuals for my initial
                        ideas for the app, I created an interactive Mid-fidelity
                        prototype to conduct some remote and in-person usability
                        tests. <p>With the help of two volunteers, I got to
                        identify any potential usability issues within the app
                        so that I could make the necessary iterations. I used
                        Google meet and in person meetings to conduct the
                        usability tests.</p> <p> I presented the participants with the
                        following task scenarios and asked them to think out
                        loud as they worked through them as I took notes and
                        asked follow up questions.
                        </p>
                      
                        Scenario: You have just opened the app and you want to
                        get a good idea about what it offers and its features
                        then carry out some tasks on the app.

                        <li>
                          Task 1: Go through the onboarding process and describe
                          your experience logging in and share any insights you
                          gain about what the app offers and how it functions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                          Task 2: Find what trips are available for booking on

                        Incorporating these features and other insights gained
                        through researching competitor websites guided my
                        wireframe creation process.

                      <p>
                        After the usability test, I created affinity maps to
                        organize user feedback and the notes I had taken during
                        the tests.
                        <p>The feedback I received from the usability tests
                        helped me iterate the UI for the app to make it more
                        intuitive, clutter-free and easy to navigate which I
                        will delve into more in the design section.</p>

                          <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
                          <p>
                            The logic behind the Travel One app name wasn't
                            clear that it's meant for solo travellers, so I made
                            it a bit more obvious by changing it from Travel One
                            to 'Travel for One'.
                          </p>
                            <p>The design for Travel for One started off as a
                            website, but from research and the usability test
                            feedback, I resolved to change Travel for One to a
                            mobile app to allow for more a personalised, more
                            intuitive user experience.

                            </p>
                            <p>During usability testing, I received feedback that
                            the compare trips button and feature was not clear
                            or obvious. Both users couldnâ€™t identify it easily.
                            It was only identifiable after spending some time on
                            the app. I decluttered the trips page by removing
                            the reviews section and adding micro text next to
                            the check boxes as well as at the top of the page to
                            give users clues for the comparison feature.

                            </p><p>There was also feedback about the contact us
                            option. One of the users preferred a floating action
                            button that allowed for chatting with the company in
                            realtime on the app for quick help on any questions
                            they may have as they navigated through the app. I
                            incorporated this feature as I felt it would be
                            within easy reach for users. </p>I also noted that
                            the connect feature for users to talk to other solo
                            travelers before or after trips to build community
                            or ask questions would be better as an in-app chat
                            forum instead of requiring them to create an
                            account. It also minimizes their commitment to the
                            app while giving them the value of insights they
                            seek to help them make travel decisions. These were
                            some of the major changes I made in the design based
                            on user feedback.

                            What Working on Travel One Taught Me
                          </h3>
                          <p>
                            I learned that users like a clutter-free, simple
                            intuitive interface that helps them access resources
                            and information they need with minimal effort.
                            Finding ways to align the conceptual model of the
                            design with the mental models that users have, made
                            the Travel for One app more likely to appeal to
                            future users. It also ensured that users would face
                            minimal friction navigating the app.</p>
                            <p>Keeping user needs and pain points in mind as
                            I came up with the design for the app helped me to
                            keep the user at the centre of the design decisions
                            and process. It also guided the prioritization of
                            features. I learned that product design is an
                            iterative process that ensures your design evolves
                            as you learn more about your user. </p><p>I got to
                            understand the importance of background research and
                            usability testing to help me put myself in the shoes
                            of the user and empathize with them while
                            understanding their motivations and addressing these
                            through the design process. I look forward to taking
                            this approach in my future designs.</p>
